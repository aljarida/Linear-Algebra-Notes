# Linear-Algebra-Notes

This is a folder that features all the code used during the production of my 89-page set of notes
for linear algebra. To access the notes without the need to compile anything, simply open the PDF.
Alternatively, you can take the source code from the .tex file into your favorite LaTeX IDE.
